	abstract="Recent advances in information extraction have led to huge knowledge bases (KBs), which capture knowledge in a machine-readable format. Inductive logic programming (ILP) can be used to mine logical rules from these KBs, such as ``If two persons are married, then they (usually) live in the same city.'' While ILP is a mature field, mining logical rules from KBs is difficult, because KBs make an open-world assumption. This means that absent information cannot be taken as counterexamples. Our approach AMIEÂ (Gal{\'a}rraga et al. in WWW, 2013) has shown how rules can be mined effectively from KBs even in the absence of counterexamples. In this paper, we show how this approach can be optimized to mine even larger KBs with more than 12M statements. Extensive experiments show how our new approach, AMIE{\$}{\$}+{\$}{\$}+, extends to areas of mining that were previously beyond reach.",

	abstract="Recent years have seen a drastic rise in the construction of web knowledge bases (e.g., Freebase, YAGO, DBPedia). These knowledge bases store structured information about real-world people, places, organizations, etc. However, due to the limitations of human knowledge, web corpora, and information extraction algorithms, the knowledge bases are still far from complete. To infer the missing knowledge, we propose the Ontological Pathfinding (OP) algorithm to mine first-order inference rules from these web knowledge bases. The OP algorithm scales up via a series of optimization techniques, including a new parallel-rule-mining algorithm, a pruning strategy to eliminate unsound and inefficient rules before applying them, and a novel partitioning algorithm to break the learning task into smaller independent sub-tasks. Combining these techniques, we develop a first rule mining system that scales to Freebase, the largest public knowledge base with 112 million entities and 388 million facts. We mine 36,625 inference rules in 34 h; no existing system achieves this scale.",

	abstract="The ever growing amount of Semantic Web data has made it increasingly difficult to analyse the information required by the users. Association rule mining is one of the most useful techniques for discovering frequent patterns among RDF triples. In this context, some statistical methods strongly rely on the user intervention that is time-consuming and error-prone due to a large amount of data. In these studies, the rule quality factors (e.g. Support and Confidence measures) consider only knowledge in the instance-level data. However, Semantic Web data contains knowledge in both instance-level and schema-level. In this paper, we introduce an approach called SWARM (Semantic Web Association Rule Mining) to automatically mine Semantic Association Rules from RDF data. We discuss how to utilize knowledge encode in the schema-level to enrich the semantics of rules. We also show that our approach is able to reveal common behavioral patterns associated with knowledge in the instance-level and schema-level. The proposed rule quality factors (Support and Confidence) consider knowledge not only in the instance-level but also schema-level. Experiments performed on the DBpedia Dataset (3.8) demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach.",
